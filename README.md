# PyChain-Ledger-Project

## I. PyChain ledger and user interface
#

As shown in these  screenshots  I has sussceffuly complete the PyChain ledger and user interface by running the  Streamlit application via my  terminal using  my development environment. I was able to  store some mined blocks in my  PyChain ledger.

## II. Blockchain Testing and Validation 
#

I was succesfully able to vadidate the following hash during the testing process

Wining Hash 00199325d51bf169bc28d20f5b22f7e8dc02fbd4b4a09b40d4aa27d5d07b6ba4
Wining Hash 004168baffc8a9385b1fe2a298d6c370dab90f826b616eb60bd8f8b207cc7a2a

During the testing process, the block difficulty was set to 5, the nonce result retruneed a very high value:  938369

## III. Conclusion & Challenge:
#
To show case of the project, a 2 mins Video has been uploaded for review via this link  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1evGyr6sG0. 
 There was one challenge in this project i wish I could resolve and test. I was not able to randomly  generate  the "creator_id". This is some interessing feature  of the PyChain-Ledger app I would like to explore in the future code. Each transation should have a unique creator_id.
